# Teaching-Excel-Project
An excel project that allowed the instant analysis of teaching and learning observations in a school. Input was set up using a Microsoft Forms and Power Automate. Stored on SharePoint and relevant staff were allowed access.

The Microsoft Form allowed the input of the relevant teaching data to be recorded in the spreadsheet.

Power Automate allowed this data to be taken and populated into the spreadsheet using a specific flow. The staff members performing the observation also had their information recorded.

This allowed senior leadership to look at how many observations staff were completing, how many times staff were being observed, as well as being able to break it down by term, week, subjects or faculties
